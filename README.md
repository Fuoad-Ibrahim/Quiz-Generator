# Quiz Generator

## Project Description
This project allows users to create their own quizzes and test themselves. There
are two types of quizzes the user has the choice of selecting from called "Exact
Answer" or "Show Answer". The Exact Answer quiz is designed to be used for 
questions which have an exact answer such as a math question. The Exact Answer 
quiz is not case sensitive or space sensitive and provides a score along with a 
score sheet showing the user which questions he got correct / incorrect after 
completing. On the other hand, the Show Answer quiz is designed to be used 
similar to que cards. The Show Answer quiz is effective when users would like to
 test themselves on questions which could have various answers. This quiz gives 
 users the option of seeing the correct answer after answering each question or 
 after completing the quiz. When ran, both quizzes ask the user a randomly 
 selected question from their quiz. 

## Requirements
This project does not require any additional python modules. To start, download and run the 
"main" file located inside the "dist" folder.
